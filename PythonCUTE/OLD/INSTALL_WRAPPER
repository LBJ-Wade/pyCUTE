Install SWIG
MacOS: [ sudo port install swig-python ]
Otherwise: [ wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.12.tar.gz ]

The Python-C interface is defined in [swigfile.i]

Set [PYTHON_INC] in [compile.sh] and [PYTHONLIB] in the CUTE Makefile
Then run ./compile_wrapper.sh

The CUTE Makefile is modified to compile a shared library instead of an executable 
(-c -> -fPIC -c to object files and -shared ... lib.so to the executable)
Run the python script [PythonCUTE.py] to check if it works and for how to use it
